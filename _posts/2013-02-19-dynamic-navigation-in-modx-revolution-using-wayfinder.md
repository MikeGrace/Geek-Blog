If you are looking to build some dynamic navigation in MODX Revolution you should check out [Wayfinder](http://rtfm.modx.com/display/ADDON/Wayfinder). It&#8217;s a great tool to get what you want done. You can find some great links to documentation for wayfinder at <http://sottwell.com/articles/wayfinder.html>

[The (almost) Complete Guide to Creating Menus in MODx Using Wayfinder](/assets/2013/02/The_almost_Complete_Guide_to_Constructing_Menus_in_MODx_Using_Wayfinder.pdf) has been really useful to me and I recommend it.
