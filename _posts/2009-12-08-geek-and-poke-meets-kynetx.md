One of my co-workers recently tweeted, &#8220;I really want to know how I missed this web comic. Hilarious!! [http://bit.ly/7das6F](http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2009/12/simply-explained-new-series-the-main-principles-of-software-engineering-part-1.html)&#8220;. That got me thinking about how much people do miss from their favorite comic sites or any site on the web for that matter. Of course you can subscribe to RSS and get all their updates but those who valiantly use and keep up with their feeds know how quickly it can become overwhelming. But what about all of the people who like sites or products but don&#8217;t know how to set up an RSS reader or who just don&#8217;t want to? How do you get your content to those people all the time without them having to type in your URL?

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  With Kynetx!!
</h1>

With [Kynetx](http://kynetx.com/) you can customize the users experience on your website AND ANY OTHER WEBSITE YOU DESIRE!!

Are you getting excited yet? Are you listening or paying attention?! Are you thinking about the possibilities??!!!

In this example, if a user really loves the comic &#8220;[Geek and Poke](http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/)&#8221; why not make the content available to them anywhere they go on the web in unobtrusive manner? In fact, if you do it well, the users will be giddy with the results and love your product even more! It&#8217;s a little known secret that people actually like advertising. THEY DO! People love to buy stuff! What people actually hate is irrelevant and irritating ads that are in their faces. I took 3 sites and customized the users experience based on the context that they really enjoy the comic &#8220;Geek and Poke&#8221;.

  * Google.com
  * CNET.com
  * CNN.com

Here are the after and before photos of what the user will see as they visit these sites.<figure id="attachment_1130" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
