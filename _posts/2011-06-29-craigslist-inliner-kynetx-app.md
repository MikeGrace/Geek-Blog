Recently while browsing a lot of Craigslist postings I got sick of clicking each link to open in a new tab just to view them. If you have spent much time on Craigslist I&#8217;m sure you have experience the same frustration. This Kynetx app is my answer to my frustration. It will present a button on listing pages that, when clicked, will load each listing inline. You can view the app and get it by visiting [http://apps.kynetx.com/installable\_apps/4445-Craigslist\_Inliner](http://apps.kynetx.com/installable_apps/4445-Craigslist_Inliner)
