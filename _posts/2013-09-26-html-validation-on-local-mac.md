I was looking for a better way to do HTML validation on web pages running on my local Mac. I found and have been using the stand alone validator from <http://habilis.net/validator-sac/>.

![Mac HTML Validator App](http://mikegrace.s3.amazonaws.com/geek-blog/html-validation/validator-SAC.jpg)

Works great and I love that it validates my local pages.
