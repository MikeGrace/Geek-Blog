The other day I misstyped a URL and now Google Chrome auto suggests the wrong URL every time. To remove this auto suggestion on cr-48

  1. Start typing the URL so it will auto suggest it
  2. Use keyboard shortcutÂ **_ctrl + alt + backspace_** 

Doing this immediately removed the suggestion from my Chrome history on my cr-48 for Chrome OS
