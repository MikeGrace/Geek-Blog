If you are writing JavaScript, you should be testing and linting your code often to catch common mistakes. I enjoy using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) so I have installed [Sublime-JSHint](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint), a Submlime Text 2 plugin that checks my JavaScript code for nasty errors and other coding goodies.

![Sublime JSHint in action](http://mikegrace.s3.amazonaws.com/geek-blog/test-your-javascript/sublime-jshint.jpg)

It&#8217;s super easy to setup so what are you waiting for?!

If you don&#8217;t use Sublime Text, find a jshint plugin for your editor over at <http://www.jshint.com/install/>
