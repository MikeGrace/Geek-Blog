[<img class="size-full wp-image-382 alignleft" title="_MIK7579" src="/assets/2009/07/MIK7579.jpg" alt="_MIK7579" width="448" height="300" srcset="/assets/2009/07/MIK7579.jpg 640w, /assets/2009/07/MIK7579-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" />](/assets/2009/07/MIK7579.jpg)I added a little quote to this picture I took to help remind me to keep working hard. The more I look at it, the more it makes me giggle. The birds pose and expression reminds me of a mother telling their kid to keep working on their homework. My wife thinks it is just weird, and you may to, but it has made me smile enough that I just had to share it. ; )

The quote is one I found by Comaneci, Nadia. The hard work quote is, &#8220;Hard work has made it easy. That is my secret. That is why I win.&#8221;
