Nice little [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin by [davidpeckham](https://github.com/davidpeckham) that allows you to find all lines matching a string or a regular expression in Sublime. After installing, on Mac, you&#8217;ll search to include lines with Regex ⌘+K then ⌘+R. That will bring up the search box. To include lines with a string use ⌘+K then ⌘+S.

Plugin available at <https://github.com/davidpeckham/sublime-filterlines>
