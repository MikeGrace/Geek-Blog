# How to tail multiple files

Terminal command: tail -f <file.name> <file.name><figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Tailing multiple files in one terminal window is a life saver when you are pressed for space on your screen.
  
With tail you can tail just about as many files as you want. I doubt it would be very useful to have more than a few tailed at the same time.
