I have used several different sites and services to register domains. [NameGuard](http://www.nameguard.com/) is hands down the best domain registration site and service I have ever used. After registering several domains with NameGuard I wonder why I ever used all the other sites out there.<!--more-->

### Why

  * **FREE Privacy Protection!!!** 
      * **Many other services charge extra, each year, for this service**
      * **If you don&#8217;t get privacy protection all of your personal information ends up in the [whois](http://www.whois.net/) directory for that domain. Bad!
  
** 
  * Industry standard pricing on domains
  * accepts paypal or credit card for payment
  * Change DNS name servers at time of registration
  * Extremely fast registration time

    Even though the girl doesn&#8217;t come with every domain name registration, NameGuard provides some of the best services I have seen yet. Click on the girl to read their list of advantages.

    This post may seem like I may be making money through some affiliation program but I make nothing from this post other than helping others enjoy the same great benefits of a great domain registration service while protecting their personal contact information
