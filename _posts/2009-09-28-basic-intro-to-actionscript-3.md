I found a really well done, easy to understand, and polished how to [video series on ActionScript 3 and Flash](http://tv.adobe.com/show/actionscript-11-with-doug-winnie/). The video series starts at the very beginning and shares how-to in 5 minute clips. I am really glad Adobe and Doug Winnie put this series together.
