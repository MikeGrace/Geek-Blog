Had a great time this weekend attending the [HTML5.tx](http://html5tx.com/) developer conference. Lots of great developers and designers in the Austin area. Was fun to meet people, learn, and review technologies and techniques for building better experiences online. Some of the things discussed at the conference were

  * HTML5 & DOM APIs
  * Advanced CSS selectors
  * HTML5 Video
  * LESS (css)
  * Modernizer, Yepnope, and Polyfills
  * CSS3 and animations
  * Building for experience not browser

  I&#8217;m excited to start using the things I learned and explore some new features and tools that I learned about.
