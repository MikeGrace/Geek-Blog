I&#8217;ve had the chance to play around with some email code recently and it&#8217;s been fun. Here is something that I learned that I think should be easier to find for those who are getting into writing an app that handles emails via IMAP.

**What is the difference between an email&#8217;s _Unique Identifier_ (UID) and an emails&#8217;s _Message Sequence Number_ (MSN?).**

  * Unique Identifier: A unique number referencing an email that does not change over time
  * Message Sequence Number: The relative position from the first message in the mailbox
