I got interviewed on KSL today on The Browser radio show about one of my Kynetx Apps that I built to filter out foul language on Twitter.com You can find the extensions at <http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/01/foul-fowl-control-kynetx-app-for-twitter-com/>

For a list of other interesting Apps/browser extensions that I and others have built for twitter, check out this blog post by Kynetx
