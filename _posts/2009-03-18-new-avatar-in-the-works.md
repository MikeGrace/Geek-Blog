<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12" title="Cassie's Illustrations" src="/assets/2009/03/img-1.jpg" mce_src="/assets/2009/03/img-1.jpg" alt="Cassie's Illustrations" height="300" width="222">Cassie is an awesome artist and illustrator! She does some really fun art and I really enjoy having her art all over the place. A while ago Cas did some cartoon sketches of me and I really liked them so she is going to finish a couple so I can use them for my sites and Avatar on twitter and other places. It is going to be really nice once we can get them finished and implemented. If you would like to follow Cassie on twitter visit her page at <a href="http://bit.ly/k9Uan" mce_href="http://bit.ly/k9Uan">http://twitter.com/illustrativecas</a>
