I built this app based on an [idea I got this morning](http://mikegrace.tumblr.com/post/2701095709/stack-overflow-kynetx-app-idea-01-11-11) and it has turned out great! I love it!

The app is built for the Kynetx team so I wont be sharing the extension with the public but I have no qualms with sharing how awesome it is. The app allows each Kynetx team member to see who on the team has viewed the KRL tagged question on Stack Overflow. A Kynetx team member can then mark that they are currently working on an answer for the question or that they have &#8220;passed&#8221; on the question. A simple tool to help coordinate the teams efforts in answering the public&#8217;s questions about KRL on Stack Overflow.
