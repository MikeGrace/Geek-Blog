I was working on building navigation based on this mockup<figure style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img title="Navigation Mockup" src="http://mikegrace.s3.amazonaws.com/geek-blog/sandbox/css-nav-border-party-mockup.png" alt="Navigation Mockup" width="402" height="77" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Navigation Mockup</figcaption></figure> 

I enjoyed building the navigation and thought what I came up with was cool enough to share what I did. 

The JavaScript added is just to simulate changing pages.
