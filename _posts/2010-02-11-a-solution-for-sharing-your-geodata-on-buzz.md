Sharing very accurate geodata on a public Google Buzz stream is a bit unnerving especially when you are &#8220;Buzzing&#8221; from home.

### **So what if I still want to share my location but not let the whole world know where my front door step is?**

Why not have an option to let the user choose the accuracy of the geodata being shared?

There is already the option to not include the data or to choose a known location on Google maps, like my local police department, but that&#8217;s not enough.

Why not have an option to share your location as the center of town.

Currently if you want a solution like this, you can select a location that is near you but not your front door step.

I hope to see better control over location sharing in Google Buzz in the future.

Until that time I am going to disable automatic sharing of my location and choose when to share.

What do you think about sharing your geolocation?

Why or why don&#8217;t you share it?

Do you have an idea to solve this problem?
