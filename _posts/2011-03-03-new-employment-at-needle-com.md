Both my wife and I are very excited to announce that I have accepted a full time job working at Needle of [Needle.com](http://needle.com/)

We feel very blessed by the many responses we received from friends and family when they found out I was without employment. We ended up having to chose between a couple of jobs and we are excited with the opportunity that Needle presents us with. We are excited to be staying in the Utah area and plan on continuing to participate in the many great tech events that happen in Utah.

It has been a crazy adventure going [from employment to unemployment](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/02/life-at-a-startup/) and back again in just a few short days. I&#8217;m excited about the work that I will be doing and I hope to continue to blog lots as I learn and work. Thank you again to every person that offered help, gaveÂ referrals, called me, offered to give a good word, tweeted, blogged, and thought about me. Here&#8217;s to an exciting future. : )
