The big thing I like about Spezify is the navigation response with the keyboard arrow keys. Try it! Left&#8230; right&#8230; up & down. Maybe if the results returned more of one kind of result based on the direction you navigated instead of just loading more results, it would be more useful. Example: If I do a search and I want to see what people are saying about the latest whatever, I&#8217;ll probably be searching for tweets. So, if tweets are shown above the middle of the returned search result screen, when I navigate up, I would expect the engine to return more tweet results rather than a potpourri of media and sites. Overall, I like what they have done but I think it needs a bit more work before it will actually get used for a lot of searching.
