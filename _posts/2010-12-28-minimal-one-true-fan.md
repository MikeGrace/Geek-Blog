I am a BIG fan of [One True Fan](http://onetruefan.com/MikeGrace). Maybe even &#8220;the&#8221; one true fan of One True Fan. ; )

I&#8217;ve noticed recently that I have been hiding the One True Fan bar a lot for various reasons. I really love the bar but I don&#8217;t always want to see it, but at the same time I always want it to be there. So&#8230; I built a Kynetx app that solves my problem and maybe others will find it useful also.

Minimal One True Fan is a Chrome and Firefox Extension that

  1. looks for the One True Fan bar on the page
  2. hides the bar
  3. takes the checked in status button and places it in the bottom left corner of the page
  4. clicking on the status button will bring the bar back

Update 01/04/2011

Updated the app to also show the avatar of the current One True Fan of the current site because who doesn&#8217;t love to see if they are the One True Fan? : D
