Recently attended Podcamp SLC and had a great time. Got to learn a bit about podcasting and wanted to try it out. In this episode I talk about podcamp, codecamp, erlang, [Kynetx impact conference](http://impact.kynetx.com/), [Needle](http://needle.com/), Utah Python user group, Kynetx free lunch friday, AT&T buying T-mobile, [Looking for the Good](http://lds.org/liahona/2011/03/looking-for-the-good), Kindle, [following too many people on Twitter](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/03/the-kynetx-app-i-really-want-to-build/).
