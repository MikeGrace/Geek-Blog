For my family blog I want to be able to allow family and friends to sign up to get access easily. I also don&#8217;t want a bunch of spam bots and people I don&#8217;t know to have access to the blog. This is why I recently started using the [New User Approve WP plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-approve/) by [Josh Harrison](http://picklewagon.com/wordpress/new-user-approve/).

The plugin is super simple and worked right out of the box. Now I am able to approve or delete users before they have access and I love it. Thanks Josh for your great work!
