Copy and paste is awesome. What&#8217;s even more awesome is having copy and paste history that is easy to use.

Bring in [Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) to your workflow and you will be pasting with efficiency like never before.

Often times I will have multiple things to copy and paste so instead of going back and forth between documents or applications I copy multiple items and then use the jumpcut history to paste all the pieces over. Be sure to set and learn the keyboard shortcut for using jumpcut. Will change the way you view your clipboard on your Mac.<figure style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
