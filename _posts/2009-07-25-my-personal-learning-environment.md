After reading an interesting post about personal learning environments I decided to try an experiment for myself like [cmduke](http://edtechatouille.blogspot.com/2009/07/my-personal-learning-environment.html) did. I had a hard time placing everthing that I wanted to on the the diagram so it is a bit messy and the proximity of each item isn&#8217;t exactly where I would like them. The diagram below represents fairly well most of the tools that I use in what I consider to be my personal learning environment.<!--more--> Feel free to 

[download my photoshop file](/assets/2009/07/MikeGraces_PLE.psd) and modify it to suit your personal learning environment.<figure id="attachment_518" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
