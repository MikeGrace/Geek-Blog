Since I passed the [Google Analytics individual qualification test](https://googlerecords.starttest.com?code=I006AFE6FEF67046C0162F774EF66066F15CE4295)Â I have been working to make the data captured in GA more actionable. I have found custom dashboards to be a great way to pull out the information that is useful to me at a glance. Note that this doesn&#8217;t replace digging through the data and asking new questions about your customers.

Not sure what you could put in a custom Google Analytics dashboard? Check out this blog post by econsultancy.com on [10 useful Google Analytics custom dashboards](http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/62828-10-useful-google-analytics-custom-dashboards).
