A few of my friends and I do. I recently found a Firefox add-on developed by Greg Hosilyk called [GoogEEFree.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10687) It is a simple search add-on that adds the option to the search bar next to the URL bar. The add-on uses a Google custom search and works like a charm.<figure id="attachment_788" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

UPDATE:
  
Within two days after writing this I had 6 friends on Twitter tell me thank you and that they hate Experts Exchange, while 1 friend basically said I was being lame. I hadn&#8217;t realized there were so many other people who despise Experts Exchange. I was also checking my visitor stats the day after posting this and came across this in my stats:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-847 aligncenter" title="experts_exchange_visit" src="/assets/2009/08/experts_exchange_visit.jpg" alt="Experts Exchange visits my blog!" width="600" height="40" srcset="/assets/2009/08/experts_exchange_visit.jpg 600w, /assets/2009/08/experts_exchange_visit-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
</p>

I am not sue how they found my post but I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing when I found out that someone in the Experts Exchange network visited my blog post on them.
