TLDR;

Example and script atÂ <http://sandbox.michaelgrace.org/phone-number-validation/>

In building an app, I needed to check for a valid phone number based on user input. After reading and learning more about US phone numbers than I cared about, I was able to come up with a basic way to check for a valid US phone number using JavaScript. It only marks a phone number as invalid if it is a phone number that is not a possible phone number or a special phone number that customers will not have (800 numbers, etc.).

I built a [US phone number validation test](http://sandbox.michaelgrace.org/phone-number-validation/) page that will test phone numbers you input and give the reason why it fails if it doesn&#8217;t pass validation. You can check it out at <http://sandbox.michaelgrace.org/phone-number-validation/>

Resources I ended up using in my research or the formulation of the algorithm:
