I am reminded again why planning and time management are so important as my wife and I begin to plan for the upcoming fall semester. Priorities will be very important as the semester rolls along as I will need them to decide what gets done first. Might have to take a little off of my plate, or maybe I am just over planning. There are soo many things that I want to get done this semester and so little time. Would love to hear any advice or experiences you have had with schedules that look like this.
