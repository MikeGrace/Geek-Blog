The first official release of the WebCite widget is now available at <http://geek.michaelgrace.org/webcite/> If you write papers, blogposts, do research, or any other kind of writting you will want to start utilizing WebCite&#8217;s archiving service. And what better way to use the service than with an easy to use Dashboard widget? [Download the widget](/assets/2009/04/webcite10wdgt.zip) now and try it out and visit [webcitation.com](http://webcitation.org/) to learn more about the service. A special thanks goes to [Andrew Hedges](http://andrew.hedges.name/) for letting me use some of his code to make the URL grabbing and pasteboard functionality work. A simple how to video is in the works to showcase all of the functionality of the widget. If you have any questions or suggestions for the widget please leave a comment or tweet me [@MikeGrace](https://twitter.com/mikegrace).
