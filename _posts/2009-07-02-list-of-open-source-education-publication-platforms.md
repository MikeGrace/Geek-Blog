In order to take my idea of creating an open source course I need to figure out how to make it available to the public. I could very easily install another WordPress blog or use WordPress MU because WordPress ROCKS but is that the best option? Is there a platform made specifically with open education in mind? Maybe. Will one platform work well with all course types? Probably not.

So in order to compile a list of possible platforms and compare their pros and cons I have created a knol that anyone who desires can contribute to. I would greatly appreciate any contributions and feedback. [Visit the knol and make contributions](http://knol.google.com/k/michael-grace/open-source-education-platforms/av2lz9jb3mvx/1#)

Here is what we have so far. ; )
