</h2>

For over a year now I have had the idea and the desire of creating a website reviewing website designs and their usability to help improve my own understanding of good design and usability practices. I could have just done it on my own and written it down in a notebook but that’s nearly as fun as creating a site and sharing my thoughts and findings with others. I am currently a student at BYU – Idaho and I just switched my major from Business Management to Computer Information Technology and I have loved every minute of it since.

I am sure that there will be those who agree with my opinions and those who don’t and I am excited about that. This site is all about learning and improving design and usability and I look forward to everyone’s feedback and participation.
