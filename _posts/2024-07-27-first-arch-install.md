# First Arch Linux Install Experience

I have a Dell XPS 13 laptop that I purchased about 8 years ago that I wanted to get running again. I watched a few different videos about different Linux distrobutions and picked a few to try. I tried MX Linux since it had the highest page hit count on [https://distrowatch.com/]. The high DPI screen didn't play nice with MX Linux out of the box. I then tried Ubuntu which was a bit better but still had issue and I wasn't impressed with the experience. Then I learned about the memes around Arch and knew I had to give it a try. I watched a tutorial and went for it. I didn't do it on hard mode and opted for `archinstall`. After getting Arch installed I then got GNOME installed and logged in. 

Wow! What an experience! GNOME is clean, handled the high DPI screen with ease, trackpad gestures were intuitive. I loved it! 

The only issue I had was the silly "killer" wireless card that doesn't play nice with Linux. Swapped that out for a [$15 Intel Wireless AC 9260](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QJQF4Y) and now it works flawlessly.

Typcraft has a great tutorial on getting set up on Arch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YE1LlTxfMQ]

## Final Thoughts

I'm really impressed with the GNOME experience. Linux has come a LONG way since I tried Ubuntu 15 years ago. Hats off to everyone that has contributed to GNOME and Arch Linux. I still have a lot of learning and work to do in order to fully switch over from Mac OS but I can see a clear path to that point. If you've been thinking about trying out Linux, now is a great time to give it a try.
