One fun way that I have found to make my comments stand out is to create an account at <http://gravatar.com/>
  
Creating a free account and uploading an avatar allows your avatar to show up on comments made on Gravitar supported sites and blogs.
  
It only takes a minute and it will take your comments from looking like this -> 

[<img src="/assets/2009/05/picture-1.png" alt="picture-1" title="picture-1" width="376" height="188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154" srcset="/assets/2009/05/picture-1.png 376w, /assets/2009/05/picture-1-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" />](/assets/2009/05/picture-1.png)

to this ->

[<img src="/assets/2009/05/picture-2.png" alt="picture-2" title="picture-2" width="324" height="149" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155" srcset="/assets/2009/05/picture-2.png 324w, /assets/2009/05/picture-2-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" />](/assets/2009/05/picture-2.png)
