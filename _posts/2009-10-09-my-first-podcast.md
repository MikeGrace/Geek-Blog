I have officially entered the world of Podcasting! The podcast is about technology and learning and incidentally enough, is hosted at <http://technologyforlearning.info> I am privileged to be able to co-produce the podcast with a good friend of mine, [http://michaelfarmer.info](http://michaelfarmer.info/). We both have a lot of fun being geeks and really digging into technology and what it means for us today and how it will impact us in the future. We are both amateurs and don&#8217;t have any formal voice training but we do love what we do. So, if you would like to join in on the fun and the conversation subscribe to the podcast and tune in each week as we review current technology and how it applies to learning.
