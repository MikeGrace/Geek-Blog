ThisÂ  error in Flash
  
`TypeError: Error #2007: Parameter child must be non-null`
  
was caused by the fact that I had not dragged the progressbar component into my library just like a problem I had before posted at <http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2009/11/1172-definition-fl-controlstilelist-could-not-be-found/>

This is now the second time I have done this and hopefully the last. ; )

Goodbye Flash error &#8220;TypeError: Error #2007: Parameter child must be non-null&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to see you again!
