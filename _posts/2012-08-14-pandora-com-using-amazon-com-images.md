Is it just me thinking this or is Pandora.com really using product images from Amazon.com? Maybe they are both using images from the same source? Who owns the image?

I&#8217;m curious as to where this original image came from and the licensing on it. Each song on Pandora.com has a link to purchase the song on Amazon so maybe they have a deal with Amazon to use the images? I can&#8217;t find anything on the web about this though and would love to see if you can find anything out. Let me know in the comments below.
