[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7" title="jQuery" src="/assets/2009/03/picture-11.jpg" alt="jQuery" width="234" height="88" />](http://www.jquery.com)I finally made enough time to put a twitter feed on my blog and man does it feel good to have that done. I found a fun <a class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" href="http://jquery.com/" rel="homepage">jQuery</a> based widget called Juitter that can be found atÂ [http://juitter.com/](http://bit.ly/IXPvU)

I changed some of the functionality and the css in the jQuery functions so it would be a little more compacte and now it is looking great. Really easy to install but if you are wanting to customize it beyond how many tweets show up you are going to need a fair understanding of jQuery.
