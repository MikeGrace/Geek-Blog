The past month has been insane and I have loved all that has happened this last week. I am now officially working for  a company called Kynetx and I am more excited to work than ever! Kynetx is doing amazing things and I really can&#8217;t believe that I am a part of it. The people I get to work with are amazing and it blows me away how smart they all are.

I spent the day learning and working on Kynetx code that was my first assignment since joining the team. I sure hope I won&#8217;t disappoint. Finally as the final hours of the day were counting down I was helping my wife make the bed when IT happened. Yes! IT happened! What is it? I was throwing the sheets up so I could get them to lay flat on the bed. When on the last throw, I threw them too hard, I hit the ugly glass plate covering our light hanging from the ceiling and it came crashing down. The largest shard was able to somehow maneuver it&#8217;s way to my head and connected with whatever sound glass makes when it hits flesh. \*{insert sound here}\* Once I got the wound covered we were able to clean it up and bandage it enough to get to bed. Here are some photos of the battle wound. Enjoy! ; D
