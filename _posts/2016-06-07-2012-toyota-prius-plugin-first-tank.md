I&#8217;ve had the car long enough now to fill up the tank once. Here are some of the numbers and calculations to go with the first tanks worth of driving.

Driving: 895 miles (366 gas + 517 electric)

Gallons of gas: 7.805

Kilowatt hours of electricity: 107

Tank miles per gallon: 46.89

Tank miles per kilowatt hour: 4.83

Total fuel cost: $30.76 = $20.29 gas + $10.47 electric
  
_(7.805g \* $2.599/g) + (107kwh \* $0.097883/kWh)_
  
_Took an average of the 2 rates from our electric company ($.088594 per kWh [first 600 kWh] and $0.107172 [remaining kWh])_

Fuel cost per mile: $0.055 gas & $0.02 electric

Combined fuel cost per mile: 3.4 cents

Fuel economy extrapolated out to 100k miles of similar driving: $3,437
  
_($0.0343687150837989/mile * 100,000 miles)_
