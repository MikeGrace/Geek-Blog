My wife and I moved to Utah almost a year ago and we have loved every minute of it. Since moving here I have been riding my bicycle a lot and not using my Honda Gold Wing so much. I decided recently that it would be a good idea to sell my motorcycle and use the money to buy my wife a computer since she has been without one since her MacBook Air died a few months ago. I&#8217;m really sad that I no loger have a motorcycle to ride but I think what I got in return is worth more. : )
