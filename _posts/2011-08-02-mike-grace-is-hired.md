A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was [looking for work and available for hire](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/07/mike-grace-is-available-for-hire/). Today I am excited to announce that I am hired!

I now get to work for [WCG](http://www.wcgworld.com/) and will be working out of their [Austin Texas office](http://www.wcgworld.com/company/contact-us/) on [6th street](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=101+W.+6th+Street,+Suite+330+Austin,+TX,+78701+&iwloc=A).

My wife and I are very excited to be in Austin, experience the culture, and bask in the warmth of the sun. We are especially excited for the warm winters that we are going to have here ;) I am excited to be part of a winning team, doing amazing things, and making a difference in the lives of others.

You can expect to continue to see me blog here and possibly on [WCG&#8217;s blog](http://blog.wcgworld.com/) as well. You can connect with me and stay up on the latest on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MikeGrace), [Facebook](facebook.com/mikegrace), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108729898843647210749/posts) where I like to share what I learn and get to know other awesome people.

A huge thank you to family, real life friends, and online friends who reached out and responded to my announcement of looking for work. It always amazes me how supportive and helpful everyone is. The response was amazing and I had lots of good options to choose from. Thank you!

Photos are from the Utah 2011 Tour de Donut ride I did recently. Last photo was taken with the famous &#8220;[Fat Cyclist](http://fatcyclist.com/)&#8221; (left) that is making a difference doing what he loves to raise money to fund cancer research and help others with cancer, and my good friend [Sam Curren](http://www.mostlybaked.com/) (right).

&#8212; SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT! &#8212;

If you haven&#8217;t checked out my latest Kynetx apps, you should because they are HOT!   The first one [filters out foul language](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/07/google-filter-kynetx-app/) and hides animated gifs on G+. The second [makes browsing craigslist much easier](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/07/craigslist-inliner-kynetx-app-update/), faster, and more enjoyable.
