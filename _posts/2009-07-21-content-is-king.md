As I surf the web looking for information and work on building the next greatest how to Linux site, I am reminded just how much content is king. You can have a great design for your sight but if you don&#8217;t have content that people want then you might as well have not posted it at all. If you want visitors to your site, make your content specific and amazing so that people won&#8217;t be able to ignore you.
