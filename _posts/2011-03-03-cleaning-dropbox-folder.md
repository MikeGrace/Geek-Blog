I love DropBox and don&#8217;t want to pay for the larger amount of space because it&#8217;s such a large jump to make. I recently went through my DropBox folder and cleaned out a bunch of files that I no longer needed in my DropBox folder. The task was made much easier with the help of a Mac app named [GrandPerspective](http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/). If you are looking to clean out your DropBox folder try this free app and I think you&#8217;ll find that it helps a lot! It shows blocks representing each file scanned in a specified folder. Hovering over each block shows where the file is located.

I was able to take my usage from 3 GB down to 692 MB. : )
