Bob Pearson posted on his blog today [10 things he has learned from Michael Dell on innovation and collaboration](http://www.pre-commerce.com/index.php/2011/08/30/lessons-from-michael-dell-on-continual-innovation-and-collaboration/). I have taken my favorite parts and shared them here.

  * We get smarter when we listen well.
  * Most innovation occurs step by step. It is rarely about the big idea.
  * Collaboration leads to the best ideas
  * The most powerful driver of human behavior online is to help your peers.
  * When companies see themselves as peers, they serve their customers well
  * People get a sense of empowerment when you allow them to participate and recognize their contribution.
  * The real action occurs after the idea is received.
  * Let go, allow your team to try new ideas, fail occasionally and end up with a great batting average.
