Before I get started let&#8217;s get 2 points out in the open:

1) Yes, at the time of this blog post I am unemployed.

2) Kynetx is still kickin butt and taking names. Kynetx FTW!

Yesterday morning I found out that I no longer had a job at Kynetx as Kynetx was shifting to plan B. Any good startup worth their salt always has a plan B and Kynetx is executing that plan B. In [Steve Fulling&#8217;s own words](http://twitter.com/#!/fulling/status/41331332592304128), &#8220;failed bridge financing. Re-aligned staffing to revenue. We&#8217;re open & okay&#8221;. I&#8217;m bummed out that I don&#8217;t get to be a part of that plan B execution but I have known since the day I joined the team that this was always a possibility and I have absolutely no regrets about joining the Kynetx team. One of my best friends, Michael Farmer, expresses my feelings better than I could over on his blog post at <http://michaelfarmer.info/people-thought-i-was-crazy>

While the last 48 hours have been a roller coaster of an emotional ride, my wife and I are very excited for the future and all of the possibilities that it holds. I am overflowing with gratitude and love for everyone on the Kynetx team family. I have grown tremendously as an individual and as a developer while working at Kynetx and have learned so very much from all the extremely smart and talented team. I gladly welcome any future opportunities to work with anyone on the team and highly recommend each one of them.

Here&#8217;s to an exciting future.

oh! And what blog post from me about Kynetx would be complete without some &#8220;Grace faces&#8221; that have become somewhat legendary within the Kynetx team.
