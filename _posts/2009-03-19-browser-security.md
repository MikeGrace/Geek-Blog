After reading an article on ZDNet about the Pawn2Own hacker event maybe I can give Google some slack. :-) I still want my Chrome ASAP if it is as good as the windows version though. Google seems to be heading in the right direction with their sandbox model for their browser. I am sad that Apple has done so little to create road blocks for hackers but I guess that is expected when you have such a low market share. Now go and read the article and make your own decision on what browser you are going to use.Â [Questions for Pwn2Own hacker Charlie Miller](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2941)
