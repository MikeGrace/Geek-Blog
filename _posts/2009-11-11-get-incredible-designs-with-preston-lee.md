Sometimes picking a designer is like finding a good restaurant, you either have to go there and try the food or ask a bunch of your friends where the best place to eat is. Well, I&#8217;m your friend and I found an AWESOME restaurant!! Actually, not a restaurant but an awesome designer!!! <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1064" title="preston_lee" src="/assets/2009/11/preston_lee.jpg" alt="preston_lee" width="73" height="73" />His name is Preston Lee and I highly recommend you follow his [blog](http://graphicdesignblender.com/), join the conversation with him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/prestondlee), AND use his ninja rock star design skills for what ever you need designing for. I recently had Preston design some business cards for me and I was floored with the whole experience and the results. Quick results, rockin designs, and was a ton of fun to work with.

I just recently started <!--more-->following Preston on Twitter and had him do my business cards but I already feel like we have been friends for a while. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better design that truly reflects my personality, my goals, is very professional, and everyone loves my card when I give it to them. If you&#8217;re still not convince about his skills and commitment to design, just check out his blog and you will find that Preston is well on his way to the top of the design industry. Anything from website design toÂ  business cards, Preston is your man for the job. So, from a friend to a friend, I promise you that you won&#8217;t be disappointed!
