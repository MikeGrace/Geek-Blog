[<img src="/assets/2009/05/google1.jpg" alt="google1" title="google1" width="329" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-145" srcset="/assets/2009/05/google1.jpg 329w, /assets/2009/05/google1-300x119.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" />](/assets/2009/05/google1.jpg)If you are looking for a good laugh you should do a google search for &#8220;the answer to life, the universe and everything&#8221;. If you are a true geek/ sci-fi nerd you will get a good laugh out of this. I can&#8217;t tell you because that would ruin the surprise but you can [try it out yourself](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=the+answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything). 

A big thanks to the guys and gals over at Google keepin&#8217; it real. ; )
