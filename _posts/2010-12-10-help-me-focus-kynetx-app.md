I&#8217;ve gotten sick of constantly going to web pages where the main thing I want to do is a search and the site doesn&#8217;t put my cursor focus in the search input box. Gah!

I have decided to make a Kynetx app that helps me with this annoyance and you are free to use it and [give feedback](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHpvMzZtcEhES2ZJeDlwQXpMTTRkV1E6MQ) (things like, &#8216;I wish it worked on this site&#8217; or &#8216;Dude! This is awesome!&#8217;).

[Example Code](https://gist.github.com/737075)

*It is currently only helping on a few sites but I will be adding sites as I run across them and people [suggest them](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHpvMzZtcEhES2ZJeDlwQXpMTTRkV1E6MQ).

If you have the extension installed and working,Â you can see a list of domains that the app is helping you focus on at the end of this post inserted by the extension.
