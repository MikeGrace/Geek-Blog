Sometimes you don&#8217;t have access to scripts you are trying to debug. Using the chrome extension [flip the script](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flip-the-script/bmkpjhjogcjpioeffjmdgclmeiiofcjp) makes it really easy to serve up local versions of files in place of the remote requests.
