Some of my friends have shown some interest in joining superuser.com, a sister site to stack overflow. The beta is only semi-private and anyone who really wants to can start contributing to the bank of knowledge being contributed there. If you really want to start that journey, you will have to follow the ewok. (aka click on him ; )

  Enjoy
