To avoid a long rant I am just going to say that I have gotten sick of marking advertisements on Facebook as &#8220;offensive&#8221; only to see more of the ads that I have marked as offensive. Is this a joke or does Facebook just not care or is it something entirely different? I&#8217;m not sure but I got sick of it so I took 30 minutes of my time and created a Kynetx application that removes ads from facebook when I use it.

Some of you might be wondering, why not just use adblockplus or a greasemonkey script?

  1. I&#8217;m crazy about Kynetx
  2. In 30 min. I had 5 deployment paths 
      1. bookmarklet
      2. information card
      3. Firefox Browser Extension
      4. Chrome Browser Extension
      5. IE Browser Extension
  3. I can expand functionality of the application in the future.
  4. There is a profit strategy that I could utilize in the future! $$$$
  5. Deploying updates and Features is instantaneous and easy
  6. Runs from the cloud so Kynetx can pull the plug if it become malicious

# YOU WANT THAT!
