[LocalTunnel](http://progrium.com/localtunnel/) Rocks! If you have never used it before, I suggest you check it out as it is an awesome tool.

The first time I fired up [MAMP Pro](http://www.mamp.info/) and LocalTunnel, I couldn&#8217;t get MAMP to serve up the correct directory. The key is making sure that the localhost host is pointing to the directory you want served up through LocalTunnel. Cheers!
