My wife and I are excited to announce that I am currently available for hire.

**More details &#8211;** 

My wife and I are willing to live just about anywhere with the exception of Idaho (been there, done that). We would be especially excited to live in any of the following areas:

  * Western Washington
  * California
  * Utah
  * Austin Texas

<a href="http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/02/life-at-a-startup/" target="_blank">I loved working for Kynetx</a> and building apps that helped make the web and browsing experience better. I also really enjoyed building <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2011/01/kynetx_app_a_day.shtml" target="_blank">tutorials</a> to help developers just getting into developing Kynetx applications. I&#8217;ve had some of my applications featured in The <a href="http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/bleep-tweets-foul-facebook-filter/" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://gawker.com/5798229/censor-your-offensive-friends-on-twitter" target="_blank">Gawker</a>, and more. I enjoy using GIT for projects. I have done work in PHP, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, used the Ruby on Rails, Django, and jQuery frameworks, and work well with HTML and CSS.

**Vision &#8211;** 

My dream is to make the world a better place and work on teams that are striving to change the world. I dream of one day being able to work on projects that will make a difference in people&#8217;s lives without having to worry about how much money I am making. I dream of one day being able to ride my bike across America, meeting people, touring this great country, and raising money for a great cause.

I dream of one day being able to help others who want to change the world but don&#8217;t have the money or the tools to do it.
