Found a great motivational post, &#8220;[Fail Upwards](http://www.cstthegate.com/davetrott/2011/11/fail-upwards/)&#8220;, that I wanted to put on my motivation board on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/mikegrace/). Clicked my &#8220;Pin it&#8221; bookmarklet to pin the post but was greeted with this sad message:

**If you want your content to be sharable on the booming social sharing site, Pinterest, then include a related and cool looking image to go with it!** &#8230; or just include a cool photo ; )
