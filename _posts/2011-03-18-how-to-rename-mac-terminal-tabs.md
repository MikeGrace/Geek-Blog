I&#8217;ve been running a lot of terminal windows lately and getting lost in all the tabs has been annoying. I started searching for a solution and figured out that it&#8217;s super easy to rename the tabs in the terminal for Mac OS X! While on a terminal tab just use the keyboard shortcut of cmd + i to pull up the inspector window and then rename it. Easy!

Unnamed terminal tabs:

Menu option to bring up inspector:

After using cmd + i to bring up Mac Terminal Inspector:

After renaming tabs in Terminal:

If when you bring the inspector window up with cmd + i and the focus isn&#8217;t in the &#8220;Title&#8221; input, you can use shift + cmd + i to put the focus there. You can then press enter to apply the title change or just press escape to apply the title change and close the inspector.
