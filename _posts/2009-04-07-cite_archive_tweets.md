[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51" title="WebCite" src="/assets/2009/04/picture-1.jpg" alt="WebCite" width="297" height="63" />](http://www.webcitation.org/)Although this applies also to websites and blogs, I think the situation with twitter is an interesting angle. With such rapid change and tweeters tweeting all over the place how can one cite a tweeters tweet? [WebCite](http://www.webcitation.org/) has, what I think, a nice solution to the dilemma. WebCite will create a cached archive of a webpage that can be a tweet, blogpost, news page, etc. and then WebCite has provided tools to help cite that page more effectively and efficiently. As a blogger, web designer, and programmer, I know by experience that web pages come and go. WebSite is an interesting tool and one that we are all going to have to use more and more as the web becomes more agile and less static.

Archiving a webpage is easy and we should all do it more. I have included a simple 3 step how to below. As more and more people voice their opinions and share their knowledge on the web credibility and authenticity of information is becoming an increasingly larger problem. One way to combat this diminishing credibility is to cite sources in your post.

[Gunther Eysenbach](#mce_temp_url#) (archived at <http://www.webcitation.org/5fs5PvtyZ>) was kind enough to take the time to read my post and correct a few things that needed fixing. I had tried to archive a single tweet which doesn&#8217;t currently work (04/07/09). Gunther Eysenbach writes more about this on his blog at [<span>http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-cite-twitter-how-to-cite-tweets.html</span>](http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-cite-twitter-how-to-cite-tweets.html) (archived on [<span>http://www.webcitation.org/5frDrQdNC</span>](http://www.webcitation.org/5frDrQdNC) )

## Simple How To

1) Find webpage to be cited. Such as a search at [<span style="text-decoration: none;">search.twitter.com</span>](http://search.twitter.com/)

2) Copy URL and run it through [<span style="text-decoration: none;">WebCite.com</span>](ttp://www.webcitation.org/archive.php) archive page.

3) Use the resulting citation links to site the tweet or webpage that you are referencing in your work.
