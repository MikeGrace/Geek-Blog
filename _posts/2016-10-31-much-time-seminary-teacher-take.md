I was curious about how much time it would take to be a [seminary](https://www.lds.org/si/seminary) teacher when I was asked to be a seminary teacher on June 17, 2014. Since I was running my own business at the time and tracking all of my work hours by project, I added seminary as a project in my time tracking app as well.

I think the amount of time it takes to be a seminary teacher in one year is going to very from person to person based on several factors. This was my first time teaching seminary and the class was an early morning class. So how much time did I spend on seminary in one year?

**488.5 hours total**

Let&#8217;s break that down since that is not the amount of time I spent teaching.

283 hours 5 minutes teaching in class, setting up class, traveling to/from class.
  
152 hours 5 minutes preparing lesson plans, study, etc.
  
51 hours 32 minutes for teacher training.
  
19 hours 27 minutes for administrative and other tasks.

Let&#8217;s useÂ [2,087 hours](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/computing-hourly-rates-of-pay-using-the-2087-hour-divisor/) as our standard for a years worth of full-time work. That means that my first year teaching seminary equalled about 1/4 of a full time job. Fascinating stuff. Hope this helps others who might be getting into teaching seminary for the first time and wondering just how much time they might expect to put into the endeavor.
