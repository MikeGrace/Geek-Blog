[3 Months ago](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2009/11/the-context-of-a-stackoverflow-junkie/) I built a Kynetx application that annotates search results that point to the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) site.

I&#8217;m very excited about releasing the next version of my Kynetx application that utilizes a recently released Kynetx action, percolation. This action digs deep into the bowels of the dark search engine pits and pulls out relevant search results.

If you&#8217;ve already been using the first version app, you already have the update. The code updated as soon as I pressed the version update button! : ) Now install the app if you don&#8217;t already have it and start having fun searching.

.. And come join us at our next Impact Conference! Developers, entrepreneurs, and everyone else is invited to come and learn because THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING! Visit <http://www.kynetx.com/> for more details.
