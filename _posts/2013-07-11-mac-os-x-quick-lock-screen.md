Want to be able to lock your computer with a keyboard shortcut?

[Since OS 8](http://smyck.net/2011/06/02/mac-os-x-keyboard-shortcut-for-locking-the-screen/) you can put the screens to sleep using Control + Shift + Eject (⌃ + ⇧ + ⏏).

## Here is how you can lock your computer from a keyboard shortcut

1. Open up your system preferences and go to Security & Privacy.

2. Check box to require password after sleep and select desired timeout.

I have mine set to require a password after 5 seconds so if my screens go to sleep while I am right there I have time to wake it up again before requiring a password.
