The Kynetx app that I built to filter out foul language on Twitter.com has filtered through over 200,000 tweets removing over 4,300 foul words!

When I originally built the app I didn&#8217;t think it would get used by enough people to get through that many tweets so quickly! I&#8217;m glad I was able to build this app and that others have enjoyed using it. If you would like to try it out you can get it at <http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/01/foul-fowl-control-kynetx-app-for-twitter-com/>
