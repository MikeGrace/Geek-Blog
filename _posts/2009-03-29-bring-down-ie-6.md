It is time to bring IE 6 to rest. The guys over at .net magazine have put together a campaign to bring awareness to everyone and we all hope that you will join up in the fight. If you are not sure if you are using the latest browser please just download the latest version of any one of the following browesers. Installing a new browser may be out of your comfort zone but it is something that just needs to be done because more and more websites aren&#8217;t looking the way they should because you are using an old browser (if you are using and old browser). And for those of you who are reading this who don&#8217;t know what a browser is&#8230; it is the program/ application you are viewing this webpage with.

This Warning applies to you if you are using an old browser!!

    If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re surfing using Internet Explorer 6, an eight-year-old browser that cannot cope with the demands of the modern internet. For the best web experience, we strongly recommend upgrading to <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, or a more recent version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx">Internet Explorer</a>.</div>
