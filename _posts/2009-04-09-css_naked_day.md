# Happy CSS Naked day!!!

A fun international day where everyone takes off their CSS. Dustin Diaz, the founder of CSS Naked Day (archived at <http://www.webcitation.org/5fuQLFhny>), says that the purpose of this holiday is, &#8220;&#8230;to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good &#8216;ol play on words. It&#8217;s time to show off your <body>.&#8221; (archived at <http://www.webcitation.org/5fuPcZGxn>)

So, I am taking this opportunity to promote the proper use of (x)html and good hierarchal structure by taking off my CSS. If you would like to join and you have a WordPress blog all you need is a simple plugin to do the work for you. The plugin is named &#8220;CSS Naked Day&#8221;.
