With a bit of free time I&#8217;ve had lately [being unemployed](http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/02/life-at-a-startup/), I was able to work on this project and finish it. I&#8217;m very happy to have it done and working so well.

### What is it?

It&#8217;s a keyboard activated search tool for a specific website built to act like the application launcher Alfred App and QuickSilver. I went through each page in the Kynetx documentation site and indexed each page by hand. I didn&#8217;t include all pages which I believe makes this a much more powerful search for Kynetx developers. I also assigned key words to each page based on what I thought it should be searchable by. If you have suggestions, let me know because I would love to hear them.

If you like it, you are free to use the code in any way that you like. Cheers!
