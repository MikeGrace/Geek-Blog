For a long time I have been coming home and switching my iPhone to forward my calls to my skype # before I lose reception. ANNOYING! Recently a good friend of mine, Kyle, found out that you can forward calls based on situation on AT&T. AWESOME! The options he found are forward all, if busy, if no answer, and if unreachable. If unreachable is the one I have been looking for and haven&#8217;t been able to find. (I haven&#8217;t been looking really hard but it should be easier to find) Setting your calls to forward when unreachable means that it will forward to that number when you don&#8217;t have reception. I have left the detailed commands at the end of the post for all of the options but will demonstrate how I set mine.

Note: After setting up the forwarding, make sure you test it so some poor lady in Seattle doesn&#8217;t get all of your missed calls for a week. ; )

Open up the phone to dial a number. Enter \*62\* then enter the number you want to forward to and then *11#

After you press send, the phone will do some magic&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" title="please_wait_iphone" src="/assets/2009/07/please_wait_iphone.jpg" alt="please_wait_iphone" width="250" height="375" srcset="/assets/2009/07/please_wait_iphone.jpg 250w, /assets/2009/07/please_wait_iphone-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />

and should show you something like this letting you know it worked.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450" title="complete" src="/assets/2009/07/complete.jpg" alt="complete" width="250" height="375" srcset="/assets/2009/07/complete.jpg 250w, /assets/2009/07/complete-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />

Now when you loose reception you can have your calls forwarded to a different number. Happy Forwarding!
