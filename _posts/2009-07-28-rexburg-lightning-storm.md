[<img class="size-full wp-image-652 alignleft" title="Fisher Price Camera" src="/assets/2009/07/fisher_price_camera.jpg" alt="Fisher Price Camera" width="144" height="113" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kratz/2536427384/)We recently had a good lightning storm here in the Rexburg area and I was able to spend a good hour practicing my night lightning shots. I really need to learn more about doing these kind of shots but it was a lot of fun. I really like the first one because you can see blue from the sky and the yellow light reflecting off the clouds from the towns below. Hope to be able to do this more in the future.<!--more-->
