I saw today that [Lanyrd.com has released a chrome and firefox extension to filter out tweets on Twitter.com about #SXSW](http://lanyrd.com/blog/2011/notatsxsw/).

I like the design they went with for the UI and it feels good to see a company like Lanyrd create an app that works similarly to what I built about 2 months ago. I decided to put my app interface in the side tray to allow for more controls. The app allows you to hide any tweet based on any word found in the tweet. It also allows you to highlight the tweet if you are interested in particular key words and it remembers your list each time you load the browser.

If you don&#8217;t have it, (you really should) you can get it and try it out at <http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/01/tweet-filter-kynetx-app/>
