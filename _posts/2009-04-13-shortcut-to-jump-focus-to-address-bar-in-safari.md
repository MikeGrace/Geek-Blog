One thing that I have found annoying that I have to use the mouse to click back up into the address bar to type in a new address. My fingers finally convinced me to do a google search for a keyboard shortcut to jump to the address bar in Safari. Surprise! There is a shortcut and it is \*\*drumroll\*\* &#8230;&#8230;.. cmd + L

And my fingers and the keyboard lived happily ever after. : )
