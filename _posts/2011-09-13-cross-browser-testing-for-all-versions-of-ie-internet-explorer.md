Ever had the urge to test your site or your client&#8217;s site on all versions of IE? Me either! Introducing [IE Collection](http://utilu.com/IECollection/). You can download the .exe that will install all the versions of IE that are compatible with your version of windows all the way back to IE 1! So whether your are feeling nostalgic or just need to get some testing done, download it from [FileForum](http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Internet-Explorer-Collection/1217189605/1) or [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Browsers/Internet-Explorer-Collection.shtml)

To celebrate this blog post on this year&#8217;s [Programmer&#8217;s Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmers'_Day), here is a this blog post as seen through IE 2&#8217;s eyes. How meta ; )
