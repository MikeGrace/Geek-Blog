I Love Dropbox! I love that as I save files, dropbox saves each version that I save so I can revert or view an older version. I recently ran into a &#8216;gotcha&#8217; with file versions. I renamed a folder with a lot of files in it within my dropbox folder. I later needed to view previous versions on the folder but they were gone since the folder name changed. Noooo!!! Get around this by telling dropbox.com to show deleted files and find the folder under the previous name.

You will then be able to go into that deleted folder and view the revision history for the file. I&#8217;m not sure how long dropbox keeps deleted files but they are kept long enough that I was able to get what I needed.
