Ever wonder how to level sound volume on a recording or podcast? The Levelator is a super simple application for Mac or Windows to level out sound volumes on a podcast recording. [Mike Farmer](http://michaelfarmer.info/blog/) and I use it for our podcast over at <http://technologyforlearning.info> and it works wonders for the times when we accidentally move away from the microphone. It&#8217;s free and it works great so what are you waiting for? Go download it from their site at <http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator>
