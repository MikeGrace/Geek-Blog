I was shocked at how well our president answered almost all of these interview questions without actually answering them. I am very concerned about the future of this beloved country.

#### Update 03/23/2010

A friend tweeted a blog post by [Thomas P.M. Barnett](http://thomaspmbarnett.com/about/index.htm) titled [The too-smart, too-controlled presidency](http://thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/2010/03/the_too-smart_too-controlled_p.html).

I thought that it voiced what I have been feeling and thinking well so I encourage you to read it but here is a quote from the post from Peggy Noonan of the Wall Street Journal on March 13-14 2010 that I found most interesting.

> Barack Obama, who interestingly gets the best treatment in the book&#8211;protect those sources!&#8211;is not immune [to criticism]. He is smart, &#8220;and he not only knew it but wanted to make sure everyone else knew it.&#8221; In meetings with aides, he controlled the conversation by interrupting whoever was talking. He is boastful, gaudily confident. Before his 2004 convention speech, a reporter asked him if he was nervous: &#8220;I&#8217;m LeBron, baby,&#8221; he answers. &#8220;I got some game.&#8221;
