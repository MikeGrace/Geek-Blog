While working on building a search tool for a documentation site I came up with this demo. I wanted to be able to execute the search much like how Google Instant currently waits for a pause in the users typing to execute the search. This is an example of how I am accomplishing that. You can check out the live demo at

This is what the demo looks like even though the code is the fun part:
