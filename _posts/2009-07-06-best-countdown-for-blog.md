This is the best free countdown widget that I have seen yet that is easy to configure and put on any blog. Looks good, easy to insert, minimal ads, and its FREE! I don&#8217;t use these contdown widgets on my blog very often but sometimes they are really fun to have. Make yours at <http://www.countdownr.com/><figure id="attachment_360" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="size-full wp-image-360 " title="countdown_widget" src="/assets/2009/07/countdown_widget.jpg" alt="countdown widget" width="318" height="94" srcset="/assets/2009/07/countdown_widget.jpg 318w, /assets/2009/07/countdown_widget-300x88.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" />](http://www.countdownr.com/)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">countdown widget</figcaption></figure> 

Would work well on blogspot (blogger), WordPress, TypePad, and many more.
