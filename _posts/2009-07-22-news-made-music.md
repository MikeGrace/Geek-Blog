I don&#8217;t usually share videos but this video has caught my eye. The makers at barelypolitical have taken news clips and made them into a song. Really amazing work taking the voices and clips to morph it into a cool song. I am sure a lot of video geeks are geekin&#8217; out over this one. The video can get a bit crude so you have been warned. The title of the video is **Auto-Tune the News #3 !!!**
