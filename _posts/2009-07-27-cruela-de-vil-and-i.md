After a trip to the movie rental store it would appear that Cruella De Vil and I have more in common than I originally thought. I guess it&#8217;s time to dig into my genealogy again. My wife always thinks I am really weird for wanting to take pictures like these but I think it is worth it when you get a gem like this one. ; ) Hmmmm&#8230; Maybe this is more insight into who I am than you really wanted to know.
