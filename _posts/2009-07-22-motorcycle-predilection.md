I really enjoy riding my motorcycle to school, work, and all around. I came out of class the other day and saw my bike parked among several other bikes and realized that I was a bit different&#8230; ; P The sight gave me something to laugh about. I&#8217;m not sure if it is funny, silly, or just weird&#8230; <!--more--> &#8230;that I am a 160 pound 24 year old college student that rides a 1200cc Honda Goldwing from the 80&#8217;s that weighs in at 700 pounds. Even if my family says I ride an &#8220;old man&#8217;s bike&#8221;, I don&#8217;t care. It rides like a dream and it can actually get up and go compared to my old &#8217;81 300cc bike I used to have.
