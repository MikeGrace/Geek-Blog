I've been having a lot of fun lately getting my websites off of WordPress. I'm now utilizing Jekyll to statically generate the website. I'm running my own git server that I commit changes to for my site. When I'm ready to push updates to my server, I run a bash script so I don't have to retype all the Jekyll build flags and properties. I've gone with a really minimal theme called [Monochrome](https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome) which I think reflects my efforts to simplify and keep things light.
