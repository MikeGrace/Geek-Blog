I just noticed this morning that Facebook got rid of the submit button on comments. Not sure where else they might have also done this but I love it!

I like this trend of getting rid of submit buttons. Done right I think it makes interfaces cleaner, simpler, and easier. With mobile devices I still think it is better to give a submit button on forms but for desktop versions I love this lack of submit buttons. I find it interesting that Google has kept their search button even when Google Instant is enabled.

That&#8217;s all. Just my thoughts on the matter. ; )
