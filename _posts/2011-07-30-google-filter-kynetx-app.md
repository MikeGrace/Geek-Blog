I have decided to release my Google+ filter app to the wild today. The app can currently filter out foul language in *postsÂ and comments and also hide animated gifs in the stream. [http://apps.kynetx.com/installable\_apps/4624-Google+\_Filter](http://apps.kynetx.com/installable_apps/4624-Google+_Filter)

You can turn the filtering on and off using the controls that will show up on the right side of the Google+ interface.

Preferences are remembered so the next time you come back it&#8217;s just the way you left it. I plan on adding a feature in the future to be able to collapse posts if they match a list of keywords that you list. I personally really look forward to this feature so I can filter out what ever I want. If you have ideas or suggestions for this app or a new app please let me know.

As seen on Tom Anderson&#8217;s G+ profile!
