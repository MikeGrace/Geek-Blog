I have always found asking questions an interesting part of life. Asking people clear, concise, and well formed questions can lead you to better information and interaction faster and with less friction. Asking questions to one&#8217;s self can bring better understanding and lead to new discovery. There is soooooooo much to learn about asking questions and the impact it has on our lives. 

My life is full of asking questions:

&#8211; Google search
  
&#8211; How could I build this better?
  
&#8211; What technology would fit this application best?
  
&#8211; What did my wife mean when she said&#8230;
  
&#8211; What does it mean?!

Jeff Atwood recently posted some interesting thoughts on asking questions titled [&#8220;Gorilla vs. Shark&#8221;](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/\). A fun and interesting read that I recommend.
