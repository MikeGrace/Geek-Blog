For those times when you find yourself yelling &#8220;My package never arrived!&#8221;&#8230;

When your Amazon shipment has been marked as delivered but you haven&#8217;t received it yet, bet sure to follow the steps outlined at <https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/help/id=201117310>

After following those steps, if you still don&#8217;t have the package in your hands, visit [http://amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us)Â and follow the steps to contact Amazon support about your missing package.

In my case, the carrier had marked the package as delivered on a Friday and upon contacting Amazon, they said it would be delivered by end of day Monday.
