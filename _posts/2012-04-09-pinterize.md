There are lots of things around the web that I would like to pin on Pinterest but there are no images to pin! Have you gotten sick of seeing alerts like this?

I have built the very simple <a href="http://mikegrace.s3.amazonaws.com/geek-blog/pinterize.html" target="_blank">Pinterize bookmarklet</a>!

It&#8217;s a simple bookmarklet that allows you to inject an image from the web into the page that you want to pin. Works on the same principle as the Pinterest bookmarklet.

You&#8217;ve been Pinterized!
