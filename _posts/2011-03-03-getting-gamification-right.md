I&#8217;ve always loved playing, learning, and games. It isn&#8217;t until the past few years that I&#8217;ve really started thinking more about gamification, what it means, how it plays a role in my life, and how I can learn from it to make better products on the web. I can&#8217;t remember who, but a friend on Twitter posted a link to a slideshare presentation &#8220;Meaningful Play. Getting Gamification Right.&#8221;

I went through each slide reading the notes at the bottom and thinking through each slide. I am genuinely impressed by the thought that has gone into this presentation. In a moment of awesomeness, I experienced an aha moment on slide #103. I found the key to understanding something that has left me perplexed since my childhood.

Back when I was younger, I was often charged with doing the dishes. I hated doing the dishes! Or, so I thought that I hated doing the dishes. Several times I had decided that I wanted to surprise my mom and do the dishes without her asking instead of the often, &#8220;Michael, will you PLEASE do the dishes?!&#8221;. Walking into the kitchen I was excited to do something nice for my mom until I heard, &#8220;Will you please do the dishes Michael?&#8221;. I was furious and my mom was confused. Even though my mom asked nicely, what changed when she asked that made me so mad? I finally understood today on slide #103. Enjoy! : )
